# Face Detection and Recognition

Face detection and recognition are fundamental tasks in computer vision and artificial intelligence. This project demonstrates how to implement both using OpenCV and Haar Cascade Classifiers.

## üë© Face Detection

Face detection involves identifying and locating human faces in images or video frames. It determines **where** faces are present, not **who** they belong to.

Several techniques are commonly used:
- Viola-Jones algorithm
- Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG)
- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
- OpenCV libraries (Haarcascade)

## üßë‚Äçüíª Face Recognition

Face recognition goes beyond detection by identifying or verifying the **identity** of a person. It matches detected faces against a known database using unique facial features.

Key steps:
- **Feature Extraction** using deep learning models like CNNs
- **Face Matching** with stored facial data
- **Classification** based on similarity scores

## üîÅ How the System Works

### 1. Face Detection  
The system scans each frame or image to locate faces using Haar Cascade or CNN detectors. Detected regions are marked with bounding boxes.

### 2. Feature Extraction  
Once a face is detected, features are extracted ‚Äî such as distances between key facial landmarks and texture patterns.

### 3. Face Matching  
Extracted features are compared with a database of known individuals to identify a match.

### 4. Classification  
If a match is found, the system labels the detected face with the correct identity.

> üõ† In this project, we used OpenCV and Haar Cascade Classifiers ‚Äî simple and lightweight, though not the most robust in terms of accuracy.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Ethical Considerations

While facial recognition systems offer powerful capabilities, it's crucial to consider **privacy**, **bias**, and **ethical use** ‚Äî especially in applications involving surveillance and personal data.
